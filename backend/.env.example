# Proxy Trust Configuration
# Controls how Express handles X-Forwarded-For headers for rate limiting and IP detection
# Options:
#   - 'true': Trust all proxies (least secure, use only in development)
#   - 'false': Don't trust any proxies (default for development)
#   - '1': Trust first proxy hop (recommended for production behind single load balancer)
#   - '2': Trust first 2 proxy hops (for multiple proxy layers)
#   - '10.0.0.1,172.16.0.0/12': Comma-separated trusted proxy IPs/ranges (most secure)
# If not set, defaults to '1' in production, 'false' in development
# TRUST_PROXY=1
